	<p>
		<b>User</b> is the ID or account number, as you would use it when logging in to the institute's web site.<br/>
	  <b>Label</b> can be set as desired, e.g. to the institute name or account number.<br/>
	  <b>Store documents in</b> should be a different path for each account, so that documents with identical names
	  from different institutes do not overwrite each other.<br/>

		A password is not configured here. It is only needed when synchronizing documents.
